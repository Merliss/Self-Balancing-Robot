# Self-Balancing-Robot
Self balancing robot on esp32 platform.

For the project a balancing mobile robot was constructed and programmed. Balancing is
carried out parallel to the trajectory. As part of the research, simulations were carried out
in Matlab and Simulink software. In addition, theoretical issues related to the inverted
pendulum balancing problem were presented. A PID controller was implemented in the
microcontroller. The control algorithm is based on data taken from the gyroscope and
accelerometer. In addition, the control of the robot via a smartphone application using
Bluetooth communication was realized.
